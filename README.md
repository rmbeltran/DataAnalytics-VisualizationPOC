## Data Analytics and Visualization Proof of Concept
The following is a demostration of some Data Analytics I performed on sales data. The goal was to identify ways to help Account Managers boost their ability to bring in recurring revenue.

### The Analysis
The analysis was done primarily using SQL on a teradata data source. First I performed some data exploration on the product sales data. During the exploration phase it is important to clearly understand the underlying business concept in order to be able to gain some context of how the data fields in our source are utilized. I also like to use data vizualization in order to understand how all of the data fields interact and what they represent when describing the sales lifecycle. For example: If a particular end customer has 50K rows of data, I would attemt to condense all of that data into something I can vizualize on a timeline or by a few other characteristics, in order to understand how the customer behaves.
